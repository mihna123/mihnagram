Just trying out css and html :D

Right now im just getting into web development. Learning html and css. 
My background knowledge is basicly pure C, so this is gonna be interesting. 
Probably the hardest part will be learnin JavaScript.
Gonna come back here after a year to see my progress. 
Have a nice day!
